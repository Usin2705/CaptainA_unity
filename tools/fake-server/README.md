# Fake Server

A local stand-in for the DTA and legacy pronunciation servers, so the app can be tested
without a backend. It lives in `tools/fake-server/`, outside `Assets`, so Unity does not
import it. It needs Python 3 and nothing else.

**What it cannot prove:** its responses are built from the app's response classes and the
server rules noted in the client's comments, not from the real server. It tests how the app
handles a response, not whether the real server sends that response. Test the app against the
real server before release.

## Quick start

1. Print the lines for `Secret.cs`:

   ```bash
   python tools/fake-server/fake_server.py --print-secret
   ```

2. Replace the matching lines in `Assets/Scripts/Utils/Secret.cs` with them. That file is
   git-ignored, so these values are never committed. Keep any real values somewhere safe first.
3. Start the server, and leave it running while you test:

   ```bash
   python tools/fake-server/fake_server.py
   ```

4. Press Play. Each request appears in the server's console.

To go back to a real backend, restore your real values in `Secret.cs`.

## Running it from Unity

**Tools > Fake Server** opens a window that starts and stops the server and changes its settings
while it runs, so no terminal or browser is needed. It runs the server on the default port, using
the Python command shown in the window, which is `python` on Windows and `python3` elsewhere.
Change that command if it is not the right one on your computer.

A server started from this window stops when Unity closes. One started from a terminal keeps
running, but the window can still change its settings and stop it, as long as it uses the default
port.

The window warns you if `Secret.cs` does not point at `http://127.0.0.1:8765`, so it also warns
after the phone setup below.

## Testing scenarios

Change behaviour while the app runs by opening a URL in a browser. The response shows the
current settings, and <http://127.0.0.1:8765/__fake/> shows them without changing anything.

| To test                       | Open `http://127.0.0.1:8765/__fake/set?...`  |
| ----------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| A request failing             | `fail=assess:503`                            |
| Several failures              | `fail=assess:503,profile:500`                |
| How long responses take       | `delay=1-3`, `delay=5` or `delay=0`          |
| Off-topic or partial answers  | `relevance=off_topic` or `relevance=partial` |
| No relevance check ran        | `relevance=none`                             |
| Advance button on the profile | `profile=top`                                |
| No position shown             | `profile=bottom`                             |
| Too few assessments           | `profile=insufficient`                       |
| Cohort too small              | `profile=cohort`                             |
| Rank unavailable              | `profile=unavailable`                        |
| Pronunciation warnings        | `warning=0,1`                                |
| Back to normal                | `reset=1`                                    |

Every request takes 1 to 2 seconds by default, so loading states can be seen. This includes requests
set to fail. Use `delay=0` to turn it off.

To stop the server, open <http://127.0.0.1:8765/__fake/stop>.

Route names for `fail` are `assess`, `onboarding`, `feedback`, `profile`, `level`, `events`,
`delete`, `mdd` and `number`.

The app chooses its error message from the status code, so these are worth trying with
`fail`: `403`, `404`, `413`, `422`, `503`, and `400` or `500` for the server's own wording.
To test **no connection**, stop the server.

## Endpoints

| Method and path                     | `Secret.cs` constant    | Response                                                       |
| ----------------------------------- | ----------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `POST /api/v1/speech/assess`        | `ASA_URL`               | Scores and labels set by the task, covering A1, A2, A2+ and B1 |
| `POST /api/v1/onboarding`           | `ASA_CONSENT_URL`       | Creates the user, or 409 if the guid has already onboarded     |
| `POST /api/v1/feedback`             | `USER_ASA_FEEDBACK_URL` | Stored, or 422 if `assessment_id` is wrongly sent or missing   |
| `POST /api/v1/analytics/comparison` | `ASA_PROFILE_URL`       | Profile stats, depending on `profile`                          |
| `PATCH /api/v1/users/level`         | `ASA_SET_LEVEL_URL`     | Stores the level, which the profile then uses                  |
| `POST /api/v1/events`               | `ASA_EVENTS_URL`        | Counts the batch, 400 if malformed, or 413 over 100 events     |
| `DELETE /api/v1/users`              | `DATA_DEL_REQUEST_URL`  | 204, or 403 if `X-Delete-Key` is wrong                         |
| `POST /asr_unity`                   | `AUDIO_URL`             | One score per character, with one mistake                      |
| `POST /asr_number`                  | `NUMBER_AUDIO_URL`      | The same, for the number                                       |

It does not score or save audio. Results depend only on the task or text sent, so they are
repeatable. `GPT_TTS` calls OpenAI directly and is not covered.

## Remembering users

Users are held in memory, so restarting the server forgets them. An unknown guid is accepted
by default, so a restart does not force the Editor through onboarding again. Use
`--strict-users` to get the real server's 404 for a user who has not onboarded.

## Testing on a phone

1. Start the server so your network can reach it:

   ```bash
   python tools/fake-server/fake_server.py --host 0.0.0.0
   ```

2. Print the `Secret.cs` lines using your computer's address, then rebuild the app:

   ```bash
   python tools/fake-server/fake_server.py --print-secret --public-host 192.168.1.20
   ```

3. Allow the port through your firewall if needed. The server has no authentication, so stop
   it when you finish.

| A request throws, or a spinner never stops       | The URL in `Secret.cs` is blank. `UnityWebRequest` throws on an empty URL rather than reporting a failed request.                                                                                                     |

| `Address already in use` when starting           | Another copy is running. Stop it, or use `--port` and print the `Secret.cs` lines again. The Unity window only works on the default port.                                                                             |

## Tests

```bash
cd tools/fake-server
python -B test_fake_server.py
```

The tests run the server over real HTTP, using bodies laid out like Unity's `WWWForm`. They
do not involve Unity, so the app itself still has to be checked in Play mode.
